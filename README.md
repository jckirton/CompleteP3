# CompleteP3

Hi! jckirton here.

This is a reposotory of the things I made duing and after my Complete Python 3 course.
In this reposotory is some simple games, side projects and some things I did while messing around.
Some of these files contain code to make colors in your terminal.
I have discovered however that these peices of code do NOT work in wondows or non-Mac terminal enviorments, hence the existance of the "no-colors" branch.
If you would like to make a verson that works in windows terminals, or find a way that works in both, feel free to fork this branch, edit the code and create a pull request.

Thanks for reading!
Regards, jckirton
